								Many multinational organizations have made dual commitments to halt deforestation and improve farmers’ livelihoods in agricultural supply chains (Ellis and Weatherer 2022, Zhunusova 2022). These commitments are of key importance given the documented link between agricultural expansion and deforestation in developing countries (Carlson et al. 2018). This deforestation, in turn, leads to dire consequences for the ecosystem services provided by tropical forests, such as carbon storage, water regulation, and biodiversity.
								Currently, many multinational organizations are attempting to prevent products harvested from illegally-deforested lands from entering the supply chains by mapping individual farmers (for an example in the oil palm value chain, see Musim Mas 2023). However, these mechanisms are very costly and impractical due to uncertain land titles and the large number of farmers involved.
								In contrast, we propose group incentives conditional on forest protection requirements as an alternative mechanism to prevent deforestation while increasing farmer welfare. Group requirements are inspired by the literature on joint liability in microlending (Banerjee 2013), the literature on social forestry schemes (Rakatamaa 2020), and the insights we collected from field research in the palm oil supply chain in Indonesia. Therein, the rural landscape can be divided into contiguous areas or villages and, within each village, farmers may cooperate (at a cost) to prevent illegal deforestation or block production on recently-deforested land. This same social capital allows farmers to transfer utility among themselves, e.g., through labor-sharing or exchanging money or goods.
								Motivated by these considerations, we construct a model of farmers who decide on how much to deforest and whether to cooperate to prevent deforestation. We prove structural results concerning the equilibrium outcomes and then calibrate the model using data we collected from field research in Indonesia, demonstrating the effectiveness of group requirements in this setting.

							Increasing the welfare of smallholder farmers in developing countries plays a crucial role in the global effort to reduce worldwide poverty and hunger. On the one hand, smallholders represent a large proportion of the world’s poor and, on the other, they produce the majority of the food consumed in developing countries. This realization has led governments and organizations around the world to implement policies aimed at increasing farmers’ yields. Although most of these policies have resulted in welfare increases, the environmental effects have been varied. While in many settings intensification policies have been linked to a decrease in deforestation, in many other settings the reverse is true. In this chapter we propose a novel explanation of these seemingly contradictory results. We achieve this through studying a detailed operational model of a farmer’s dynamic decisions of land-clearing and production. We show the importance of considering the interaction between random production costs and liquidity constraints faced by smallholder farmers. These two elements are key to our main result: a reduction in the cost of intensification can lead to lower defor- estation rates when the variation in production costs is high enough compared to the cost of intensification. Alternatively, the same reduction in the cost of intensification may lead to higher deforestation rates if the variation in production costs is low enough compared to the cost of intensification. This result helps explain the discrepancies seen in practices and may allow policy makers to better target interventions in order to achieve win-win situations: improvement of smallholder welfare and protection of the natural forest.

								To respond to pandemics such as COVID-19, policy makers have relied on interventions that target specific
								population groups or activities. Because targeting is operationally challenging and contentious, rigorously
								quantifying its benefits and designing practically implementable policies that achieve some of these benefits
								is critical for effective and equitable pandemic control. We propose a flexible framework that leverages
								publicly available data and a novel optimization algorithm based on model predictive control and trust region
								methods to compute optimized interventions that can target two dimensions of heterogeneity: age groups
								and the specific activities that individuals normally engage in. We showcase a complete implementation
								focused on the Ile-de-France region of France and use this case study to quantify the benefits of dual
								targeting and to propose practically implementable policies. We find that dual targeting can lead to Pareto
								improvements, reducing the number of deaths and the economic losses. Additionally, dual targeting allows
								maintaining higher activity levels for most age groups and, importantly, for those groups that are most
								confined, thus leading to confinements that are arguably more equitable. We then fit decision trees to explain
								the decisions and gains of dual-targeted policies and find that they prioritize confinements intuitively, by
								allowing increased activity levels for group-activity pairs with high marginal economic value prorated by
								social contacts, which generates important complementarities. Because dual targeting can face significant
								implementation challenges, we introduce two practical proposals inspired by real-world interventions —
								based on curfews and recommendations — that achieve a significant portion of the benefits without explicitly
								discriminating based on age.

							Many operational settings share the following three features: (i) a centralized planning system allocates tasks to workers or service providers, (ii) the providers generate value by completing the tasks, and (iii) the completion of tasks influences the providers’ welfare. In such cases, the planning system’s allocations often entail trade-offs between the service providers’ welfare and the total value that is generated (or that accrues to the system itself), and concern arises that allocations that are good under one metric may perform poorly under the other. We propose a broad framework for quantifying the magnitude of value losses when allocations are restricted to satisfy certain desirable guarantees to the service providers. We consider a general class of guarantees that includes many considerations of practical interest arising (e.g., in the design of sustainable two-sided markets) in workforce welfare and compensation, or in sourcing and payments in supply chains, among other application domains. We derive tight bounds on the relative value loss and show that this loss is limited for any restriction included in our general class. Our analysis shows that when many providers are present, the largest losses are driven by fairness considerations, whereas when few providers are present, they are driven by the heterogeneity in the providers’ effectiveness to generate value; when providers are perfectly homogenous, the losses never exceed 50%. We study additional loss drivers and find that less variability in the value of jobs and a more balanced supply-demand ratio may lead to larger losses. Lastly, we demonstrate numerically using both real-world and synthetic data that the loss can be small in several cases of practical interest.

								Given a simple graph G, a set 𝐶⊆𝑉(𝐺) is a neighborhood cover set if every edge and vertex of G belongs to some G[v] with 𝑣∈𝐶, where G[v] denotes the subgraph of G induced by the closed neighborhood of the vertex v. Two elements of 𝐸(𝐺)∪𝑉(𝐺) are neighborhood-independent if there is no vertex 𝑣∈𝑉(𝐺) such that both elements are in G[v]. A set 𝑆⊆𝑉(𝐺)∪𝐸(𝐺) is neighborhood-independent if every pair of elements of S is neighborhood-independent. Let 𝜌<sub>n</sub>(𝐺) be the size of a minimum neighborhood cover set and 𝛼<sub>n</sub>(𝐺) of a maximum neighborhood-independent set. Lehel and Tuza defined neighborhood-perfect graphs G as those where the equality 𝜌<sub>n</sub>(𝐺′)=𝛼<sub>n</sub>(𝐺′) holds for every induced subgraph 𝐺′ of G. In this work we prove forbidden induced subgraph characterizations of the class of neighborhood-perfect graphs, restricted to two superclasses of cographs: 𝑃<sub>4</sub>-tidy graphs and tree-cographs. We give as well linear-time algorithms for solving the recognition problem of neighborhood-perfect graphs and the problem of finding a minimum neighborhood cover set and a maximum neighborhood-independent set in these same classes. Finally we prove that although for complements of trees finding these optimal sets can be achieved in linear-time, for complements of bipartite graphs it is NP-hard.

							Data for optimization problems often comes from (deterministic) forecasts, but it is naïve to consider a forecast as the only future possibility. A more sophisticated approach uses data to generate alternative future scenarios, each with an attached probability. The basic idea is to estimate the distribution of forecast errors and use that to construct the scenarios. Although sampling from the distribution of errors comes immediately to mind, we propose instead to approximate rather than sample. Benchmark studies show that the method we propose works well.

							A new methodology is laid out for the modeling of commodity prices, it departs from the "standard" approach in that it makes a definite distinction between the analysis of the short term and long term regimes. In particular, this allows us to come up with an explicit drift term for the short-term process whereas the long-term process is primarily driftless due to inherent high volatility of commodity prices excluding an almost negligible mean reversion term. Not unexpectedly, the information used to build the short-term process relies on more than just historical prices but takes into account additional information about the state of the market. This work is done in the context of copper prices but a similar approach should be applicable to wide variety of commodities although certainly not all since commodities come with very distinct characteristics. In addition, our model also takes into account inflation which leads us to consider a multi-dimensional system for which one can generate explicit solutions.

							This paper analyses the effect of including high school grade rankings as a new factor in the admission process to Chilean universities. The paper evaluates the impact of different weighting strategies of the high school grade ranking and identifies socioeconomic and gender characteristics of the students who benefited and were harmed by the inclusion of this new factor. Starting with the weightings of the different factors considered in the Admission Process for 2012, we simulate, using a selection algorithm, alternative weightings for high school grade rankings in the 2013 Admission Process. We also evaluate the effect of the actual increase in the weighting of grade ranking in the 2014 admission process. Even though the impact on students' entrance and exit from the selection list is rather small, the introduction of the high school grade ranking into the admission process has an effect on the composition of the students selected, producing greater socioeconomic and gender equality.

							Unit commitment decisions made in the day-ahead market and during subsequent reliability assessments are critically based on forecasts of load. Traditional, deterministic unit commitment is based on point or expectation-based load forecasts. In contrast, stochastic unit commitment relies on multiple load scenarios, with associated probabilities, that in aggregate capture the range of likely load time-series. The shift from point-based to scenario-based forecasting necessitates a shift in forecasting technologies, to provide accurate inputs to stochastic unit commitment. In this paper, we discuss a novel scenario generation methodology for load forecasting in stochastic unit commitment, with application to real data associated with the Independent System Operator of New England (ISO-NE). The accuracy of the expected load scenario generated using our methodology is consistent with that of point forecasting methods. The resulting sets of realistic scenarios serve as input to rigorously test the scalability of stochastic unit commitment solvers, as described in the companion paper. The scenarios generated by our method are available as an online supplement to this paper, as part of a novel, publicly available large-scale stochastic unit commitment benchmark.

							Fire has a significant impact on timber production on many forest
							landscapes. In this article we describe how we used the method of generating
							a discrete set of fire scars described in Kulhmann et al. (2015) to generate
							a set of fire scar scenarios which we incorporated in a two stage stochastic
							linear programming (SLP) timber harvest  scheduling model. We solve the
							resulting SLP model to produce timber harvesting  strategies which we
							evaluate by assessing how well they perform in a simulated forest
							management planning environment in which fire burns a portion of the forest
							each  period. We explore how the quality of the SLP solution varies as the
							number of fire  scar scenarios varies and the sensitivity of the solutions
							to some of the parameters of  the fire simulator. We then compare the
							performance of the SLP solutions with those  produced when fire is ignored
							and when a traditional burn probability model is used to  estimate the
							probability that each stand will burn. We found that the SLP solutions
							produced only slightly better expected returns but significantly better
							performance  with respect to risk measures.

							We study an extension of the classical college admission problem where applicants have strict preferences but careers may include ties in their preference lists. We present an algorithm which enables us to find stable assignments without breaking ties rules, but considering flexible quotas. We investigate the properties of this algorithm-stability, optimality-and we show that the resulting algorithm is neither monotone nor strategy-proof. The mechanism is used to solve real instances of the Chilean college admission problem. Among our results, we show that the welfare of students is increased if flexible quotas and a student-optimal assignment are combined. Finally, we argue why such assignment may be desirable in the Chilean context.
